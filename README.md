# Soil Power Sensor

This repo contains the EagleCAD source files for the PCB design of the Soil Power Sensor. The Soil Power Sensor is a iteration on the design of CurrentSense by Lab11(https://github.com/lab11/CurrentSense). Information on the calibration and evalutation including instructions, data files, and scripts are available in the repo, https://github.com/jlab-sensing/soil-power-sensor-calibration.

## Compatibility

Both versions 2.0.0-a.5 and 2.0.0-a.6 use the same topology but different resistors and are therefore compatible.
